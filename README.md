🚀 Exploring the Future of Collaborative AI with "Calor-IA"! 🌐

I'm thrilled to introduce "Calor-IA", my latest project showcasing the power of multi-agent AI systems working together towards a common goal.
🔎 The Challenge:
 Design and implement a system where 3 specialized AI agents collaborate to compete in a Kaggle challenge, each contributing unique expertise.
🛠️ The Toolkit:
LangChain for building dynamic and intelligent agents
LangGraph to orchestrate complex, graph-based workflows
Google Generative AI and Gemini to boost agent reasoning, creativity, and embedding capabilities
💡 The Outcome:
 A dynamic, collaborative AI system that demonstrates how intelligent agents can reason, coordinate, and solve real-world competitive problems — not just working alone, but building on each other's insights.
This project highlights my skills in:
 ✅ Multi-Agent System Design
 ✅ Advanced AI Workflow Orchestration
 ✅ LangChain, LangGraph, and Google AI Integration
 ✅ Problem Solving in Competitive Data Science (Kaggle)
🌟 I believe collaborative AI frameworks like this will be fundamental to the next generation of intelligent systems.
